          <p>We've all experienced this: an idea strikes, and we immediately envision the solution. It feels obvious, impactful, universal. So we build it. Months later, we're left wondering why no one is using what we've created.</p>
          
          <p>The journey from problem to solution is fraught with cognitive traps:</p>
          
          <ul class="space-y-2 ml-6">
            <li><strong>Confirmation bias</strong> leads us to ask leading questions that validate our assumptions</li>
            <li><strong>False consensus effect</strong> convinces us that our own experiences are universal</li>
            <li><strong>Survivorship bias</strong> means we only hear from successful products, not the countless failures</li>
            <li><strong>Selection bias</strong> skews our user interviews towards those who already engage with similar solutions</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>These psychological patterns consistently derail even well-intentioned validation efforts.</p>

          <p>The temptation to skip validation is particularly acute in the zero-to-one phase. However, as Rob Snyder articulates, it is demand (not pain points or problems) that justifies building a product. Customers may acknowledge a problem exists, but unless they are actively seeking solutions and willing to pay for them, that problem is not acute enough to warrant investment.</p>
          
          <p>As a regular observer of communities like r/SaaS and r/startups, a pattern emerges once you look past the promotional posts: developers invest months building complete products, only to struggle with adoption. They possess technical skill and genuine conviction, yet they've built solutions for problems that either don't exist or aren't sufficiently painful to change behaviour.</p>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>This is why continuous user engagement is non-negotiable. Lightweight MVPs, iterative feedback loops, and (most critically) customers willing to pay before the product is built represent the gold standard of validation. Payment is the most honest signal of genuine demand.</p>
          
          <p>These principles apply equally to new features and strategic initiatives within established products. Nearly every experienced product leader will emphasise the same point: validate before you build, not after.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The True Cost</h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>With this website, I am documenting case studies to examine the true cost of building products that no one uses. These costs extend far beyond the initial development investment:</p>
          
          <ul class="space-y-2 ml-6">
            <li>Team demoralisation and burnout</li>
            <li>Ongoing maintenance and infrastructure expenses</li>
            <li>Opportunity cost of features not built</li>
            <li>Erosion of stakeholder confidence</li>
            <li>Technical debt from rushed pivots</li>
            <li>Customer confusion from abandoned initiatives</li>
            <li>Wasted marketing and launch resources</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>If even a handful of teams validate their assumptions before committing resources as a result of reading these case studies, the effort will have been worthwhile.</p>
