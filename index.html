    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Ashwini</strong>, a <strong>Product Manager</strong> passionate about building products that solve real user problems and drive measurable business outcomes.</p>
    
    <p>I believe great product management starts with <strong>deep empathy for users</strong>, understanding their pain points and translating those insights into impactful solutions. I rely on both <strong>qualitative and quantitative data</strong> to inform decisions, ensuring every product choice is grounded in evidence, not assumptions.</p>
    
    <p>My approach is highly <strong>experimental</strong>: I validate hypotheses early, test frequently, and learn fast. Whether at the 0→1 stage or scaling established products, I treat every initiative like a startup, balancing vision, validation, and delivery discipline.</p>
    
    <p>Before moving into product management, I worked as a <strong>software engineer</strong>. I still love to build — whether using <strong>no-code</strong> and <strong>low-code tools</strong> or experimenting with <strong>AI-assisted IDEs</strong> like Windsurf. This hands-on mindset helps me stay close to the technical craft and collaborate effectively with engineers.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Favourite products and tools</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Design & Productivity:</strong> Canva, Notion, Figma, Obsidian</li>
      <li><strong>Developer Tools:</strong> Git, Docker, VS Code, Windsurf</li>

    </ul>
