    <h2>Building an Integrated Platform for Charity Teams (2–10 Members)</h2>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> June 2024 – October 2025 | <strong>Status:</strong> Active MVP with engaged user base</p>
  
    <h3>Problem Space</h3>
    <p>
      Across the UK, over 12,000 charity groups with teams of 2–10 people operate in local communities. These are the champions who raise funds for playgrounds, maintain green spaces, and protect local biodiversity — yet their administrative workflows remain highly fragmented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finances are managed in spreadsheets, event plans sit in Google Docs, and communication happens in WhatsApp groups. Despite their impact, these charities often work with modest annual turnovers (£5k–£15k), meaning platform fees from fundraising tools quickly erode what little surplus they have.
    </p>
    <p>
      While tools like QuickBooks, Asana, or Classlist exist, they are broad, business-focused, and fail to address the distinct operational and financial needs of volunteer-led organisations. The opportunity was clear: design a lightweight, integrated platform to help charity teams of 2–10 members reduce administrative overhead and spend more time creating local impact.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Product Opportunity</h3>
    <p>
      The vision was to simplify financial upkeep, event management, and reporting through a single accessible platform. By consolidating existing tools into one workspace, charity teams could automate reconciliation, plan events collaboratively, and improve transparency with trustees and donors.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Target outcomes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce time spent on financial admin by 40%.</li>
      <li>Provide real-time visibility of funds across events and months.</li>
      <li>Enable secure collaboration among treasurers, coordinators, and auditors.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Discovery & Beachhead Strategy</h3>
    <p>
      To ensure focus, we began with a clearly defined beachhead segment: charities with 2–10 members that run recurring fundraising events and manage finances manually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through 23 structured interviews, we mapped their workflows and identified friction points across the admin lifecycle. Using a weighted scoring system to quantify problem severity, we prioritised opportunities as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Financial management:</strong> 70% – tracking income, expenses, and platform fees.</li>
      <li><strong>Event management:</strong> 20% – planning, scheduling, and task coordination.</li>
      <li><strong>Gift Aid handling:</strong> 10% – important but already covered by several free HMRC-approved tools that many charities simply weren’t aware of. Given time constraints, we decided not to rebuild this functionality and instead directed users to those existing solutions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These insights directly informed our MVP roadmap — starting with the highest-impact workflows first.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Lightweight MVPs</h3>
  
    <h4>1. Financial Management MVP</h4>
    <p>
      We built a browser-based tool that allows treasurers to upload CSV files from bank accounts or fundraising platforms and automatically reconcile transactions. The system provides a clear view of spending by event, month, or category — without requiring setup, training, or logins.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Client-side architecture for privacy and zero hosting costs.</li>
      <li>Automated summaries and downloadable reports for committees.</li>
      <li>Instant deployment — ready to use on first visit.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>2. Event Calendar MVP</h4>
    <p>
      To address event coordination, we launched a simple Notion template integrating a shared calendar, meeting scheduler, and key deadlines for grant and fundraising submissions. It served as an easy entry point for groups hesitant to adopt new software.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Community Engagement</h3>
    <p>
      Adoption grew through grassroots engagement rather than paid marketing. We joined online forums, Facebook groups, and charity networks to share resources and templates, building credibility and trust. In parallel, we launched social channels curating relevant updates for charity organisers, which steadily increased organic reach and feedback loops.
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li><strong>87 charity groups</strong> actively using at least one MVP feature.</li>
      <li><strong>68% 90-day retention</strong> among early adopters.</li>
      <li><strong>40% self-reported reduction</strong> in time spent on monthly reconciliation.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Validated strong need for lightweight, sector-specific admin tools for charities of group sizes 2–10.</li>
      <li>Built trust through active participation in community networks.</li>
      <li>Established a foundation for future integration of reporting and compliance modules.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>
      We are currently developing a unified dashboard that brings together financial tracking, event planning, and communication into a single workspace. The next phase will focus on optional premium features such as audit trails and advanced reporting — with the goal of making the platform sustainable while keeping the base product free for grassroots charities.
