    <h2>Building a Financial Management Platform for Small UK Charity Groups</h2>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> June 2024 – October 2025 | <strong>Status:</strong> Active MVP with validated user base</p>
  
    <h3>Problem Space</h3>
    <p>Charity groups with teams of 2–10 people often rely on fragmented tools to manage their finances. Project planning, event management, and financial tracking are handled separately, leading to duplicated effort and lack of transparency. Our goal was to create an integrated platform to manage events, communication, and finances in one place — helping charity teams simplify administration and focus on impact.</p>
  
    <h3>Discovery & Insights</h3>
    <p>We conducted 23 in-depth interviews with treasurers and volunteer coordinators to understand their current workflows. The research revealed three consistent themes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Manual spreadsheet processes made reconciliation and reporting time-consuming.</li>
      <li>Teams wanted a shared workspace that reduced financial errors and simplified collaboration.</li>
      <li>Existing accounting tools were too complex or expensive for small, volunteer-run organisations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These findings shaped the initial MVP: a lightweight financial management tool tailored for small charities.</p>
  
    <h3>Design & Implementation</h3>
    <p>We focused on simplicity and accessibility. The MVP was designed as a client-side web app requiring no setup or onboarding friction. Key features included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated CSV parsing for expense and income reconciliation.</li>
      <li>Built-in reporting templates for transparency with trustees and donors.</li>
      <li>Permission-based sharing for committee members and auditors.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The front end was developed using React with lightweight local storage, ensuring privacy and zero hosting costs. This approach also allowed instant updates without dependency on backend infrastructure.</p>
  
    <h3>User Adoption & Validation</h3>
    <p>The MVP was introduced to charity teams across the UK through community networks and direct outreach. Our team visited charity offices and community centres to demonstrate the product and gather live feedback.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>64 organisations</strong> actively using the platform within the first three months.</li>
      <li><strong>71.9% retention</strong> over a 90-day period.</li>
      <li>Average of <strong>2 hours saved per reconciliation cycle</strong> (self-reported).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Usage patterns indicated the highest adoption among groups managing multiple fundraising events or grant reports. Feedback emphasised the tool’s simplicity and trustworthiness — two qualities users prioritised over advanced automation.</p>
  
    <h3>Building a Community</h3>
    <p>We built early traction by engaging directly with charity coordinators through Facebook groups and local volunteer networks. The platform’s credibility was strengthened by word-of-mouth referrals and in-person sessions where we demonstrated the tool and captured feature requests. This grassroots engagement approach helped us maintain a consistent feedback loop and evolve features based on genuine needs.</p>
  
    <h3>Outcomes & Next Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Validated the need for a lightweight, integrated financial tool for small charities.</li>
      <li>Achieved sustained usage across multiple regions in the UK.</li>
      <li>Currently expanding reporting modules and introducing optional integrations with cloud accounting systems.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our next phase focuses on revenue validation through premium features such as advanced reporting and multi-user audit trails, while preserving the simplicity that made the MVP successful.</p>
