            <div class="meta">Duration: June 2024 - October 2025 | Status: Active MVP with validated user base</div>
        </header>

        <div class="executive-summary">
            <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
            <p>This case study documents the development and validation of a financial management tool for small UK charity groups. After an initial product failure that resulted in zero customer acquisition, I conducted user research with 23 stakeholders, pivoted to a simplified free tool, and achieved adoption by 64 charity groups with 71.9% retention over 90 days. The project demonstrates key lessons in user validation, distribution strategy, and product-market fit development in the nonprofit sector.</p>
        </div>

        <section>
            <h2>Problem Space and Market Context</h2>
            
            <h3>Market Opportunity</h3>
            <p>The United Kingdom has over 12,000 registered small charity groups with operational teams of 2-10 volunteers. These organizations manage essential community infrastructure including playground maintenance, park conservation, and local fundraising initiatives. According to Charity Commission data, most groups handle £5,000-£15,000 in annual revenue, with operations managed entirely by volunteers balancing professional careers and family responsibilities.</p>

            <h3>Operational Challenges Identified</h3>
            <p>Initial observation of a local playground fundraising group in Islington revealed significant operational inefficiencies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial management conducted via multi-tab spreadsheets requiring 3-4 hours of weekly maintenance</li>
                <li>Communication fragmented across WhatsApp groups, resulting in poor searchability and decision tracking</li>
                <li>Event planning and task management handled through unstructured shared documents</li>
                <li>Manual reconciliation of transactions from multiple platforms (PayPal, bank statements, fundraising sites)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="quote">
                "I'm a volunteer treasurer, not a trained accountant. I need to understand our financial position without spending multiple hours performing manual calculations each weekend."
                <cite>— Emma, Treasurer, Highbury Fields Playground Friends</cite>
            </div>

            <h3>Initial Hypothesis</h3>
            <p>The identified opportunity suggested that a purpose-built software solution could address these operational inefficiencies. Projected impact calculations indicated that saving 5 hours per month per organization would translate to approximately 720,000 volunteer hours annually across the UK charity sector.</p>

            <p><strong>Critical Error in Assumptions:</strong> This analysis focused on the functional problem (poor tooling) while underestimating the behavioral barriers to adoption, including switching costs, trust factors, and the actual severity of pain points relative to existing workarounds.</p>

            <h2>Initial Product Development and Market Failure</h2>
            <p class="meta">Phase 1: June - November 2024</p>
            
            <h3>Product Specifications</h3>
            <p>I developed a full-stack SaaS platform with the following capabilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Event creation and budget allocation framework</li>
                <li>Transaction recording with multi-category taxonomy</li>
                <li>Financial dashboard with monthly cash flow visualization</li>
                <li>CSV export functionality for annual accounting requirements</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Technical Architecture:</strong> Next.js frontend, PostgreSQL database (Supabase), deployed on Vercel. Development timeline: 4 months of evening and weekend work concurrent with full-time employment as a Product Manager in the fintech sector.</p>

            <h3>Go-to-Market Execution</h3>
            
            <div class="timeline">
                <div class="timeline-item">
                    <div class="timeline-date">Week 1 (October 2024)</div>

                    <div class="timeline-date">Week 4-8</div>
                    <p>Content marketing approach: developed landing page and published educational blog content on charity financial management. Traffic averaged 12 visitors per week with minimal engagement.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Key Business Insight</h4>
                <p>By November 2024, the project had consumed approximately 200 hours of development time and generated £47 in monthly infrastructure costs with zero validated customer demand. The founding organization (partner's charity group) completed one trial session and subsequently reverted to their existing spreadsheet-based workflow.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Root Cause Analysis of Failure</h3>
            <p>Post-mortem analysis identified four critical failure points:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Failure Factor</th>
                    <th>Impact</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Distribution Gap</strong></td>
                    <td>No established channel to reach decision-makers at point of need or frustration</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Migration Friction</strong></td>
                    <td>Perceived effort of transferring historical financial data exceeded perceived benefit</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Trust Deficit</strong></td>
                    <td>Unknown platform requesting access to sensitive financial information created adoption barrier</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Pain Threshold</strong></td>
                    <td>Existing solutions, while inefficient, functioned adequately enough to prevent switching behavior</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>In December 2024, I made the decision to shut down the SaaS platform, decommission the database, and cancel hosting services. At this point, I seriously considered abandoning the project entirely.</p>

            <h2>Strategic Pivot and User Research Phase</h2>
            <p class="meta">Phase 2: January 2025 - June 2025</p>
            
            <h3>Catalyst for Reassessment</h3>
            <p>In January 2025, I attended a networking event for Friends of Parks organizations in Camden (approximately 30 representatives from different community groups across London). Rather than presenting the failed product, I engaged in unstructured conversations to understand operational challenges.</p>

            <p>The discussions revealed consistent pain points across multiple organizations:</p>
            
            <div class="quote">
                "Administrative overhead consumes more time than actual program delivery. The inefficiency is substantial."
                <cite>— James, Secretary, Clissold Park User Group</cite>
            </div>

            <div class="quote">
                "Our group raised £8,000 in the previous fiscal year, but platform fees consumed £640 of that revenue. That represents two complete bench renovation projects."
                <cite>— Priya, Treasurer, Stamford Hill Community Garden</cite>
            </div>

            <h3>Structured Research Methodology</h3>
            <p>Between January and March 2025, I conducted 23 semi-structured interviews with representatives from 18 distinct charity organizations. The research focused on three key questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which operational tasks consume the most volunteer time?</li>
                <li>Which operational costs represent the highest financial burden?</li>
                <li>Which problems would justify a financial investment versus nice-to-have improvements?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research Findings</h3>

            <div class="metrics">
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <div class="metric-value">78%</div>
                    <div class="metric-label">Cited platform fee tracking as primary pain point</div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <div class="metric-value">61%</div>
                    <div class="metric-label">Reported difficulty with year-end AGM reporting</div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <div class="metric-value">43%</div>
                    <div class="metric-label">Expressed need for improved volunteer coordination</div>
                </div>
                <div class="metric-card">
                    <div class="metric-value">22%</div>
                    <div class="metric-label">Required Gift Aid assistance (existing tools adequate)</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Critical Insight:</strong> The core problem was not "absence of appropriate software" but rather "transaction reconciliation requires excessive time and produces unreliable outputs." This represented a more specific, actionable problem statement than the original hypothesis.</p>

            <h3>Strategic Pivot Decisions</h3>
            <p>Based on research findings, I implemented three fundamental strategic changes:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Monetization Model:</strong> Shifted from subscription SaaS to zero-cost tools, eliminating authentication, database infrastructure, and recurring operational expenses</li>
                <li><strong>Product Scope:</strong> Focused exclusively on financial reconciliation as the highest-severity pain point</li>
                <li><strong>Distribution Strategy:</strong> Prioritized integration within existing community channels rather than attempting to extract users to a new platform</li>
            </ol>

            </div>

            <h4>Distribution Approach</h4>
            <p>Rather than broad marketing campaigns, I focused on organic distribution through established community channels. I had spent the previous three months actively participating in 4 Facebook groups (providing financial management guidance without product promotion). The tool launch included a screen recording demonstration featuring my partner's organization using the product in a real workflow.</p>

            <h4>Adoption Metrics</h4>

            <div class="metrics">
                <div class="metric-card">

                </div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Measurement Methodology:</strong> Integrated an optional feedback mechanism that pre-populated email templates with organization names. 19 users completed the feedback process. Additionally, I conducted follow-up conversations with 8 users to validate quantitative findings.</p>

            <h3>MVP #2: Event Planning Template</h3>
            <p class="meta">Launch: May 2025</p>
            
            <h4>Product Specifications</h4>
            <p>A pre-configured Notion template combining event calendar functionality, task management, and role assignment capabilities. Development time: approximately 2 hours.</p>

            <h4>Distribution and Results</h4>
            <p>Shared through the same Facebook community channels, with an additional link placement in the financial tool's footer. The template received 142 downloads within the first three weeks of availability. Due to Notion's platform limitations, granular usage analytics were not available. However, I received 6 direct email communications confirming utility.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Learning:</strong> In certain contexts, workflow organization tools deliver comparable value to custom software solutions. Users prioritize functional utility over technical sophistication.</p>

            <h3>MVP #3: Gift Aid Tracking (Declined)</h3>
            <p>During the research phase, multiple organizations mentioned Gift Aid tracking as a challenge. Further investigation revealed that HMRC and several charity organizations already provide free, adequate tools for this use case. Building a competing solution would not address a genuine market gap.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Declined to pursue development. This represented an important exercise in product prioritization and resource allocation.</p>

            <p class="meta">March 2024 - Present</p>

            <h3>Strategic Approach</h3>
            <p>I reframed my role from product developer to community participant, implementing the following tactics:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>In-person engagement:</strong> Attended 6 Friends of Parks networking events across London. Focused on listening and providing operational assistance rather than product promotion</li>
                <li><strong>Educational content creation:</strong> Developed guides including "Platform Fee Analysis for Fundraising Tools" and "Year-End Financial Reporting Template for Small Charities." Distributed through community channels without product references</li>
                <li><strong>Network facilitation:</strong> Connected organizations facing similar operational challenges, establishing reputation as a helpful resource rather than a vendor</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Learnings and Strategic Insights</h2>

            <h3>1. Distribution Strategy Supersedes Product Quality</h3>
            <p>The initial SaaS platform possessed superior technical capabilities compared to the CSV-based tool. However, it achieved zero adoption due to distribution failures. The simplified tool, despite functional limitations, achieved significant traction through community-embedded distribution.</p>

            <h3>2. Pricing Friction in Mission-Driven Markets</h3>
            <p>Eliminating all financial barriers (pricing, authentication, data storage commitments) resulted in immediate adoption acceleration. However, trust remained a significant barrier, requiring community credibility to overcome.</p>

            <h3>3. Problem Specificity and Product Focus</h3>
            <p>The original vision encompassed comprehensive charity management functionality. However, focusing exclusively on the highest-severity pain point (financial reconciliation) enabled faster validation and established credibility for potential future expansion.</p>

            <h3>4. Monetization Challenges in Volunteer-Driven Sectors</h3>
            <p>Small charity organizations operate with constrained budgets and high volunteer turnover. While they readily adopt free tools, monetization pathways remain unclear. This represents an unresolved strategic challenge.</p>

            <h3>5. Critical Error: Building Before Validation</h3>
            <p>Investing 6 months in product development prior to conducting user research represents the project's most significant failure. Early research would have identified the financial reconciliation opportunity and prevented substantial wasted effort on the initial SaaS platform.</p>

            <h2>Future Development Roadmap</h2>

            <h3>Near-Term Development (3-6 Month Horizon)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Open Banking Integration:</strong> Automated transaction import eliminating manual CSV downloads. Requires third-party API integration (Plaid or TrueLayer) at £0.10-0.30 per user per month. Necessitates monetization strategy to offset infrastructure costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Event Attribution:</strong> Automated transaction-to-event linking based on date patterns and transaction description analysis</li>
                <li><strong>Accounting Report Generation:</strong> Automated profit and loss statements and balance sheets formatted for AGM compliance requirements</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Monetization Strategy Development (Unresolved)</h3>
            <p>Currently evaluating three potential monetization approaches:</p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Model</th>
                    <th>Structure</th>
                    <th>Risk Assessment</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Freemium</strong></td>
                    <td>Basic features free, £5-10/month for automation and advanced reporting</td>
                    <td>Uncertain willingness to pay among target user base</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Platform Fee Model</strong></td>
                    <td>Integrated fundraising with 4% fees (vs. 8% industry standard). Retain 0.5% as platform commission</td>
                    <td>Complex development requirements but superior unit economics</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Institutional Sponsorship</strong></td>
                    <td>Local councils or grant organizations subsidize platform for constituent groups</td>
                    <td>Extended sales cycles, limited scalability potential</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p><strong>Current Strategic Focus:</strong> Prioritizing optimization of the free product offering to achieve 200-300 active organizations with sustained 70%+ retention before implementing monetization testing.</p>

            <h3>Long-Term Vision</h3>
            <p>Development of a comprehensive operating system for small charity organizations encompassing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial tracking and compliance reporting</li>
                <li>Reduced-fee fundraising capabilities</li>
                <li>Event coordination and volunteer management</li>
                <li>Automated AGM reporting and regulatory compliance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This vision requires successful monetization validation and represents a multi-year development timeline. Current focus remains on solving the core financial reconciliation problem effectively.</p>

            <h2>Reflection: Product Management Competencies Demonstrated</h2>
            
            <h4>1. User-Centered Problem Definition</h4>
            <p>This experience reinforced the importance of focusing on validated user problems rather than assumed solutions. Initial attachment to the SaaS platform prevented recognition of market signals indicating misalignment with user needs.</p>

            <h4>2. Research-Driven Decision Making</h4>
            <p>The project's trajectory changed fundamentally after conducting structured user research. This validated the principle that discovery must precede development in product methodology.</p>

            <h4>3. Distribution as Product Strategy</h4>
            <p>Product-market fit requires not only solving real problems but also establishing viable pathways to reach users at their point of need. Distribution strategy represents a core component of product strategy, not an afterthought.</p>

            <h4>4. MVP Discipline</h4>
            <p>The financial reconciliation tool represents genuine minimum viable product thinking—technically unsophisticated but functionally sufficient for validation purposes. This contrasts with the over-engineered initial platform.</p>

            <h4>5. Evidence-Based Validation</h4>
            <p>Rather than scaling prematurely, I focused on achieving meaningful retention metrics (71.9% at 90 days) before considering expansion. This demonstrates understanding of validation thresholds before scaling investment.</p>

            <h4>Areas Requiring Further Development</h4>
            <p>I am continuing to develop competency in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monetization strategy for mission-driven products serving price-sensitive users</li>
                <li>Prioritization frameworks for managing feature requests with limited development resources</li>
                <li>Scaling community-led distribution channels</li>
                <li>Balancing user needs with business model sustainability in nonprofit-adjacent markets</li>
            </ul>
