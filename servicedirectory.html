        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Challenge</h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>A UK-based charity with over 20 years of experience supporting vulnerable communities identified a critical gap: social services exist, but the people who need them most cannot easily find or access them.</p>
          
          <p>Existing resources were inadequate. Google Maps listings were incomplete, service websites focused on institutional promotion rather than practical user information, and the most valuable knowledge (direct experiences from people who had actually accessed these services) remained unshared and invisible.</p>
          
          <p>The charity's founder recognised the potential of technology to address this disconnect. Inspired by successful hyperlocal discovery platforms like Flush (public facilities) and Park4Night (overnight parking), they envisioned a similar solution for social services. However, whilst they understood the transformative potential of digital tools and AI, they lacked the technical expertise to translate vision into execution.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Discovery and Validation</h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>I was engaged to lead product strategy and validate whether this problem warranted a technical solution. We began with comprehensive user research.</p>
          
          <p>Working with the charity's volunteer network, we conducted 50 structured interviews with vulnerable individuals across the region. The research confirmed several critical insights:</p>
          
          <ul class="space-y-2 ml-6 list-disc">
            <li>Services were fragmented and difficult to discover through conventional channels</li>
            <li>People relied on word-of-mouth recommendations, but this knowledge rarely scaled beyond immediate networks</li>
            <li>Lived experience provided far richer information than official listings (accessibility, staff attitudes, actual wait times, eligibility nuances)</li>
            <li>Trust was paramount; users needed to know information came from people with similar experiences</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Market Analysis</h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>I conducted a competitive landscape assessment across the UK and comparable international markets:</p>
          
          <p><strong>UK:</strong> No equivalent service existed. Existing directories were either government-run databases (difficult to navigate, outdated) or charity-specific portals (siloed by organisation rather than user need).</p>
          
          <p><strong>International comparators:</strong></p>
          <ul class="space-y-2 ml-6">
            <li><strong>United States:</strong> <a href="https://www.1degree.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">1degree</a> provided a model for verified, community-contributed service information</li>
            <li><strong>Australia:</strong> <a href="https://askizzy.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">AskIzzy</a> demonstrated the viability of mobile-first service discovery for people experiencing homelessness</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The analysis revealed a clear opportunity: the UK market lacked a user-centred, community-validated platform for social service discovery.</p>

        <div class="space-y-4 text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          <p>I facilitated a series of vision-setting and outcome-definition workshops with key stakeholders, including charity leadership, frontline workers, and community advocates. These sessions established:</p>
          
          <ul class="space-y-2 ml-6 list-disc">
            <li><strong>Product vision:</strong> A trusted, community-maintained platform that connects people to the social services they need, when they need them</li>
            <li><strong>Success metrics:</strong> Measurable improvements in service discovery, reduced time to access support, increased awareness of available resources</li>
            <li><strong>Roadmap prioritisation:</strong> Phased approach starting with information aggregation, progressing to community contributions and personalised recommendations</li>
